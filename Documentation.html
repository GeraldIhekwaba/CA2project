Step 1: Setting up the project:
-Create a new directory for the project.
-Navigate to the directory and install the required prerequisites using "pip install".
-Open an editor such as Visual Studio and create a new main Python file called "run.py".
-Import Flask and create a new Flask app instance.
-Set the debugging value to True to see the changes made in real-time without the need to restart the server.

Step 2: Styling and Templates:
-Create a base template called "base.html" that holds the background styling.
-Create a "route.py" file that handles the mapping of URLs to the web application's navigation bar options using "@app.route()".
-Create HTML files for the different pages of the web application.
-Import the base design using Jinja Templates.

Step 3: Setting up the database (SQLite 3):
-Ensure that Flask-SQLAlchemy is installed.
-Import Flask-SQLAlchemy in "init.py" and create an instance of it called "db" by passing the Flask app as an argument.
-Create a configuration dictionary to locate the database file "app.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///market.db'".
-Create classes for "Item" and "User" tables that contain the necessary details that would be entered into the database.
-Use DB Browser for SQLite to create, update, edit, and delete table records.
-Link each table to one another using a foreign key to identify which user in the User table owns an item.

Step 4: Form Creation and Validation:
-Use Flask-WTF to create and display forms.
-Import the required fields for the form such as "StringField", "PasswordField", and validators like "Email", "DataRequired", "ValidationError".
-Create registration and login forms.
-Validate each field before committing it to the User table in the database.
-Use Bcrypt to hash the password entered by the user during the registration process to protect it from being visible in the database.

Step 5: Item Selling and Purchasing:
-Update the item table in the database with the products to be displayed on the market.
-Create a purchase and sell form using modals and assign functionality to each of them.
-Assign the forms to the current logged-in user.


By following these steps, you can build a fully functional online store using Flask.
